# codsoft_2_CreditCardFraudDetection

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project within the CodSoft Internship Experience! This project represents the successful completion of the second task, focusing on developing a robust machine learning model for identifying and preventing fraudulent activities in credit car transactions.

Project Overview
In this project, the goal was to implement an advanced machine learning model capable of accurately detecting credit card fraud. The model uses a dataset specifically curated for credit card transactions. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
